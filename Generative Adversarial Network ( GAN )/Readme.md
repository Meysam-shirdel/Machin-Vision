# A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Implemented in Python
This project is a Generative adversarial Network which can be trained on both Mnist and Fashion_mnist datasets from Tensorflow.
The network consists of a class called GAN and by creating an instance of the GAN, our model is ready to get trained.
buffer_size is gained from the dataset and batch size is initialized by 256.


## How to Run...!
- 1- Make an instance of our GAN class (our model).
- 2- Train the model using train method. At the end of the training process, it will show the result image made of 16*16 images of dataset.
- 3- To test the model, use predict method.
