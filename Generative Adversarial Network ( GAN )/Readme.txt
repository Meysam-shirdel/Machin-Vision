This project is Generative adversarial Network trained on both Mnist and Fashion_mnist datasets from Tensorflow.
The network consists of a class called CGAN. Several methods of the CGAN should be used to create a GAN network
and add a Generator and a Discriminator to it. Then, it would be ready to train and predict.
